\subsection{Description}

Box 1 contains:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The main instrument structure.
\end{itemize}

See Figure~\ref{figure:box-one}.

The box is a custom-made wooden crate and is lined with foam. There are three 10-g impact indicators and temperature sensors on the outside of the box (see Figure~\ref{figure:box-one-external-sensors}) and three 5-g indicators and temperature sensors inside the box on the upper section of the main structure (se Figure~\ref{figure:box-one-internal-sensors}).

Box 1 is $75 \times 67 \times 97$ cm ($L \times W \times H$) and has a weight of 110 kg.

\subsection{Unpacking Instructions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Verify that the external 10-g impact indicators are not activated. If they are, consult with the UNAM team before proceeding further.
\item Verify that the external temperature sensors are not activated. If they are, consult with the UNAM team before proceeding further.
\item Remove the 16 screws that fasten the lid of the box. Remove the lid.
\item Verify that the internal 5-g impact indicators are not activated. If they are, consult with the UNAM team before proceeding further.
\item Verify that the internal temperature sensors are not activated. If they are, consult with the UNAM team before proceeding further.
\item Remove the foam sheets between the front of the instrument and the box. See Figure~\ref{figure:box-one-packing}.
\item Connect a harness to the lifting eye-bolts  (DR-ME-SST-LEB). In Mexico, we used two two slings (DR-ME-MH-SL) and 
five connecting links (DR-ME-MH-CL). See Figure~\ref{figure:box-one-packing}.
\item Lift the support structure using a crane. Remove the box. Lower the support structure.
\item Remove the harness.
\item Fasten the lid in place with 16 screws.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Repacking Instructions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Verify that the external 10-g and internal 5-g impact indicators are not activated. If they are, replace them with spares from Box 28.
\item Verify that the external and internal temperature sensors are not activated. If they are, replace them with spares from Box 28.
\item Connect a harness to the lifting eye-bolts  (DR-ME-SST-LEB). In Mexico, we used two two slings (DR-ME-MH-SL) and 
five connecting links (DR-ME-MH-CL). See Figure~\ref{figure:box-one-packing}.
\item Lift the instrument.
\item Wrap the instrument in foam and plastic sheet.
\item Lower the instrument into the box.
\item Remove the harness.
\item Pack the space between the front of the instrument and the box with foam sheets. The aim here is that the force of impacts are not transfered to the L1L2 barrel.
\item Add desiccant.
\item Fasten the lid in place with 16 screws.
\end{enumerate}

These counterweights are the nominal set for one set of legs.
    \item Assorted bolts to fasten the counterweights to the support structure.
\end{itemize}

The counterweights are wrapped in plastic. The bolts are packed in a plastic bag. The contents are placed in a cardboard box, lined on all sides with 25 mm polystyrene foam sheets. The space around the contents is filled with polystyrene packing peanuts. See Figure \ref{figure:box-eleven-contents} and \ref{figure:box-eleven-packing}.

Other counterweights are packed in Box 25.

Box 11 is $30 \times 30 \times 20$~cm ($L \times W \times H$) and has a weight of 11 kg.
